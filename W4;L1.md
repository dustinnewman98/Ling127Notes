## Word Order ☝️

Can be surprisingly complex!
The most common is **SOV**, second most common is SVO (English).

Object-initial word orders are the *least* common (OSV, OVS).

The basic word order is **the one that is stylistically unmarked** or neutral, the least emphasized, highlighted, or focused.

- For example, in English you definitely *can* say "The <u>pancake</u>, Bill ate." or "The pancake, Bill ate it!"
- However, those are **context-dependent** and thus are not the basic word order.
- These two examples do not mean that English is OSV or Topic SVO (respectively), but merely demonstrate that word orders can be flexible and ultimately the basic word order is never as easy as you would think 🙃

## Prepositional Languages 💞🔛🔥

In prepositional languages, the noun follows the preposition.

In English, it is a bit strange but the possessor **precedes** the possessed (i.e. "Ayda's table" not "table Ayda's")

## HW1

Biblical dialects are fine (as long as specified).

The first line of examples should be the transliteration into Latin characters (i.e. pinyin).

## Balkan Spachbund

Most Slavic languages do not have definite articles! But they have indefinite.

Languages that are in the same region can exhibit similar properties

- Ex: Albanian, Bulgarian, and Romanian all have definite articles as suffixes despite all three being from different language families (Albanian, Slavic, and Romance families respectively).

## Cases

**Genitive** - possessive; morphological markings of possessors

- ex: "John's book," "Mary's house"

**Dative** - prepositional/postpositional; morphological markings of recipients or beneficiaries (*who is receiving something? who is benefitting from this?*)

- ex: "I got the book **from John**" where "John" is the recipient/beneficiary

## Syncretism

**Syncretism** -Two forms have the same pronunciation/are identical

- ex: "you" in English can refer to both singular and plural second person, and we make no distinction in the language (the two are identical/merged together and thus called **syncretic**)

## Sidebar

Went over lexical classes (nouns, verbs, adjective, conjunctions, adverbs, demonstratives, articles (indef and def)) in English

- saw the Czech has no indefinite articles but rather a pronoun

## Syntactic Relations :family:

**Agent** - The executor of the action of the clause.

- Similar to subject
- ex: "<u>John</u> gave Mary a book." " <u>The dog</u> ate food."

**Recipient** - The receiver of the action of the clause.

- ex: "John gave <u>Mary</u> a book."

**Theme** - Something receiving the action of the clause.

- ex: "John gave Mary <u>a book</u>."

**Patient** - Something changing its state through the action of the clause.

- ex: "John burnt <u>the book</u>."

**Experiencer???** - The person experiencing the sensation of the clause?? idk

- ex: "<u>John</u> is sick." John here is not initiating the act of being sick, therefore he is not the agent, but rather the person experiencing the sickness

**Instrument** - Something used by the agent to carry out the action of the clause.

- ex: "He opened the jar with <u>the knife</u>."



There is rarely a clear cut line between these, at best they are vague and are not meant to be rigorous but rather general guidelines.

## Greenberg's "Universals" üåé 

*Spoiler*: Not really universal

There are **not** in actual order.

1. In declarative sentences with a nominal subject and object, the dominant order is <u>almost always</u> one in which the subject precedes the object
2. In **prepositional** languages, the genitive <u>almost always</u> follows the governing nnoun (i.e. the possessor follows the thing they possess)
   1. English is an exception!
3. In **postpositional** languages, the genitive must *always* precede the governing noun
4. If a language has dominant VSO order in declarative sentences, it always puts interrogative words first in interrogative word questions
5. If it has dominant SOV order in declarative sentences, there is never such an invariant rule
6. In VSO languages, wh-words occupy a position different from the corresponding **non**-wh word. The position of such wh-words is <u>almost always</u> on the left edge of a clause
7. Languages with dominant VSO order are <u>almost always</u> prepositional
8. Languages with dominant SOV order are <u>almost always</u> postpositional
9. Languages with dominant SOV order and that have the genitive following the governing noun, then the adjective will *always* follow the noun
10. All languages with dominant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic word order.

We are supposed to check if the language we are studying obeys these universals and note which ones it does not.

## Sidebar

Make sure to test your speaker for ungrammatical constructs

## Relative Clauses üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüë¶

Usually, the relative/restricting clause *precedes* the common noun

ex: Japanese:

[kono	kinoo		kata]		hon

this		yesterday	bought		book

'This book [which I bought yesterday]'

- English is an exception!
- In English the relative clause always *follows* the head noun



### Finite Verbs ‚è≥

If a verb is **finite**, it is **tensed**

- "to buy" is not finite because you cannot say if it's past or present
- "bought" IS finite because it is in the past
- "go" "went" and "gone" are all tensed (present, past, past participle)

If a verb is **non-finite**, it is **not** tensed/in the infinitive form

- "to buy" is non-finite

Usually, in relative clauses, the verb is *non-finite* (i.e. the verb has a different form from that of a simple main clause verb and usually the agreement with the subject or tense is reduced or absent altogether)



### Internal Headed Relative Clauses üêç

Restricted to **verb-final** languages

- If your language is verb final, test to see if you can have internally-headed relative clauses

ex: Navajo:

[tl'eedaa'	**hastiin**		yalti-ee]		alhosh

last night	**man**		speak-REL	sleep

'The man [who spoke last night] is sleeping'

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice:** In Navajo, the head of the relative clause "man" is actually INSIDE the relative clause rather than outside it (as in most languages (i.e. notice in English that "man" precedes the relative clause and in Japanese "man"/the head would follow the relative clause, but regardless both languages have the head **outside** the relative clause))

### Verb Phrases üèÉ 

Usually in verb phrases, we look for tense (i.e. finite vs non-finite). Most languages have prefixes or suffixes as these tense markers. We can also look for the case of the verb (i.e. passive vs active):

#### Passive üòå

- passive: "It was done by him" // "The book was bought by John"
  - you CAN delete "by him" and jus say "It was done"
- active: "He did it" // "John bought the book" üìñ 



Japanese actually has a **passive morpheme!**

Yooko-ga		Masao-ni		nagur-ate-ta

Yooko-SBJ		Masao-by		hit-PASSIVE-PAST

'Yooko was hit by Masao'



#### Causative üí™

"I made him leave"

- You are causing something to happen
- English has causative verbs: 
  - made ("I made him leave")
  - had ("I had him clean the room")
  - "let" would not be causative (i.e. "I let him leave" is not causative - you did not *cause* him to leave)

Once again, Japanese has a **causative morpheme**

Masao-ga		Yooko-o		naj-ase-ta

Masao-SBJ		Yooko-DO	cry-CAUSE-PAST

'Masao made Yooko cry'



### Speech Acts üí¨ and Etc.

The "type" of sentence

- declarative
- imperative
- exclamation
- interrogative/question



Japanese has an interrogative marker

Taroo-wa	kita-ka

Taroo-TOP	came-INT

'Did Taroo come?'



Also consider:

- various **speaker attitudes**
  - doubt, certainty, eyewitness, evidential, etc.
- **honorifics**, used for politeness
- **moods** 
  - indicative
  - subjunctive
  - conditional
- **aspects**
  - inceptive
  - ongoing
  - habitual
  - completed
- **tense**
- **negation**

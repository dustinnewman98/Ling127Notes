## Language Classification

*Q: What does it mean for two languages to be "related"?*

A: They have the same ancestor/parent language (**proto-language**), and likely similar features.



*Q: What is the difference between a language and a dialect?*

A: There is not a clear line. Generally, a dialect must be mutually understandable to every other dialect of a given language. However, it is not always that easy. Case in point, Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese are considered "dialects" even though they are not mutually understandable due to political factors. Sociopolitical factors also determine what is considered a "language" and what is considered a "dialect."



*Q: At what point do we know that we have "enough" data to make conclusions?*

Something to consider! No definite answer hehe :man_shrugging:

### Language Families

Similar to ancestry trees, languages have ancestry trees, showing the ancestors and descendants of languages, creating **language families.**

Language family - A group of languages that have one common ancestor.

- Each language family will have **sub-families.**
- The common ancestor is called the **proto-language**.
- If two languages do not descend from a common ancestor, then they are NOT related.

### Language Comparison

The *comparative method* establishes similarity between languages by comparing vocabularies and syntaxes, as well as sound similarities.

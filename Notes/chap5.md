# Chapter 5: Case

**Case** is merely a way of **coding/marking** the grammatical **role** played by a noun, adjective, or pronoun in a phrase.

- ex: "The dog bit the man" - Dog üê∂ is in the *nominative* (i.e. subject) case; man üë® is in the *accusative* (i.e. direct object) case

## Primary Markings üñç 

### Different/Suppletive Forms

English, being primarily an analytic language, has different pronouns ([suppletive forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppletion)) depending on the case (i.e. grammatical role):

- <u>She</u> loved <u>him</u>
- <u>He</u> loved <u>her</u>
- *<u>She</u> loved <u>he</u>
- *<u>Her</u> loved <u>he</u>

### Suffixal Casemarking

In German, you can mark the case with suffixes:

Der						Hund		beisst		den						Mann

the.MASC.SG.**NOM**		dog			bites		the.MASC.SG.**ACC**		man

"The dog bites the man"



Den						Hund		beisst		der						Mann

the.MASC.SG.**ACC**		dog			bites		the.MASC.SG.**NOM**		man

"The man bites the dog"



Notice how we did NOT change the word order or use different words or forms to communicate the cases (grammatical roles) of the phrase, but rather changed if the definite article ended in "n" or "r". This is *suffixal casemarking*.

### Suprasegmental Case Marking

When a suprasegmental (something not truly part of the word but rather an accent, stress, or intonation "attached" to the word) can change the case

In Maasai, "goat" is:

- k√≠n√® if NOMinative
- k√≠n√© if ACCusative

## List of Cases üìù 

While there are many, many different cases and what cases are actually expressed/used depends on the language the key ones are:

- Nominative (`NOM`) - Case of subjects
- Accusative (`ACC`) - Case of (direct) objects 
- Genitive (`GEN`) - Case of possessors
- Dative (`DAT`) - Case of recipients and beneficiaries (indirect objects)

In addition there are two "special" ‚ú® cases that are only used in ergative-absolutive languages:

- Egative (`ERG`) - Case of subjects in transitive phrases (<u>He</u> loved her)
- Absolutive (`ABS`) - Case of subjects in intransitive phrases (<u>She</u> came, <u>He</u> died) and objects in transitive phrases (He loved <u>her</u>)

### Functional Analysis üîÑ üëÄ 

Languages with extensive case marking systems often have very flexible word order. If we look at this fact through the functional approach, this may be because the *purpose* of expressing case/role in the sentence is accomplished through markers, so there is no need to have a fixed word order.

## Case Alignments üß≠ 

**Alignment** is the use of case marking on the nominal arguments (subjects and objects) of transitive and intransitive phrases.

Two main types:

### 1. Nominative-Accusative

What English is.

The **subjects** always align. The object is the one that's different.

- ex: Mary left.
  - Here "Mary" is the subject of an intransitive phrase.
- ex: Mary helped Bill.
  - Here "Mary" is the subject of a transitive phrase. Bill is the object of a transitive phrase.
  - Note that "Mary" is marked the same (that is to say, not at all) in both sentences.
  - The **subjects** agree.
- ex: She ran.
- ex: She hit her.
  - "She" is marked the same in both sentences. But "her" is marked different because it is the **object** of a transitive phrase. (If it was marked the same it would be "She hit she.")

### 2. Ergative-Accusative

Here, the **subject of an intransitive** phrase and the **object of a transitive** phrase agree (i.e. the subjects do NOT always agree)

kupi		waya		kunu-nka

fish			that			water-LOC(ative)

'that fish is in the water'

- here fish is the **subject of an intransitive** and is in the ABS case



kupi-nku		milna		taca-mu

fish-ERG			fly			bite-PAST

'the fish bit the fly'

- here fish is the subject of a **transitive** and is in the ERG case (note that case marker `nku`)



na-tu		kupi		wala-m

I-ERG		fish			kill-PAST

'I killed the fish'

- here fish is the **object of a transitive** and is in the ABS case (notice once again no case marking)



In the above examples, see how only the ABS case is marked. The ERG cases agree and comprise the **subject of an intransitive** and the **object of a transitive**

### Split-Ergative / Active-Stative

Some languages exhibit *both* nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive alignments.

- Often this is to express **thematic/semantic role** or the agency of the subject

ex: Guarani

| <u>a</u>-x√° | <u>se</u>-rasi | <u>a</u>-gweru aina      | **se**-reraha          |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 'I go'      | 'I am sick'    | 'I am bringing them now' | 'It will carry me off' |

- Notice how "I" can change depending on the **thematic role** of the speaker in the sentence
- In 1 and 3, the speaker is the *agent* and is marked using "se"
- In 2 and 4, the speaker is the *experiencer* and is marked using "a"
- In Guarani, to say "a-rasi" would imply that the speaker was sick purposefully.

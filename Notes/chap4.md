# Chapter 4: Word Order

There are 6 possibilities for word order:

1. SOV
   1. most common
   2. Turkish
2. SVO
   1. English
3. VSO
   1. Welsh
4. VOS
   1. Malagasy
5. OVS
   1. Hixkaryana
6. OSV
   1. Panare



There was a linguist Joseph Greenberg who primarily looked at word order according to:

- Adpositions: pre- or post?
- SVO order
- Adj and N order
- Genitive and N order

## Greenberg's "Universals" üåç 

### No. 1 ‚òùÔ∏è 

"In declarative sentences, the dominant word order is almost always where the subject precedes the object."

- Basically, OVS and OSV languages are very rare

The "dominant"/basic word order is the one that is the *least* stylistically marked (i.e. has the least intonation, emphasis, or focus).



### No. 2 ‚úåÔ∏è 

"In prepositional languages, the genitive almost always follows the noun it possesses."

- "the possessor follows the possessed Thing"
- English is a notable exception

You would expect if a language has:

```
ci		taabal		ji

PREP	table		the

'on the table'
```

then it would have

```
taabal-u		Ayda
table-u			Ayda
"Ayda's table"
```

where "Ayda" follows the table she owns



### No. 12 ‚òùÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

"If a language is VSO, it puts interrogative words first in interrogative-word questions"

- Basically, in VSO languages, wh-words occupy a ‚ú® special ‚ú®  position; they are almost always on the left edge of the sentence just like English

"If a language is SOV, there is not such an invariant rule"

- Basically in SOV languages, anything goes
- ex: Hindi lets you move wh-words all over the damn place



## Verb-Final Typology

ex: Japanese

```
taro-wa		inu-o		mita
Taro-TOP	dog-ACC		saw

"Taro saw the dog"
```

In verb final languages, the order of pre-verbal NPs (any noun phrase or anything that comes BEFORE the verb) is fairly free. Different orders usually signal differences in topicalization (i.e. "<u>Bill</u>, I saw" (I didn't see Mary) this topicalizes "Bill") or focus

Japanese uses the `-wa` morpheme to topicalize

```
hon-wa		Masao-ga		kat-ta
book-TOP	Masao-SUB		buy-PAST

"The book, Masao bought"
```

### Morphology üìö 

**Suffixes** are more common than prefixes (i.e. Japanese has hella suffixes)

### Adpositions

**Postpositions** are more common than prepositions.

### Adjectives

Usually **precede** noun [Dem Num Adj N] but are many exceptions ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Usually agree with the noun much more often in gender, number, and case than verb-initial languages

### Genitives

The genitive usually precedes the noun (like English)

- "Basma's smile" rather than "the smile of Basma" ü§Æ 

### Wh-Movement

Usually none (in-situ üè†)

## Verb-Initial Typology

ex: Tamazight of the Berber languages

```
idda		uryaz		ghLr-igran
PERF+he+go	man			to-fields

"The man went to the fields"
```

In verb-initial languages, there is usually a stricter order than verb-final. They usually follow [V S DO Oblique]

### Morphology üìö 

Affixes at all are less common than verb-final, but when they are present they are usually **prefixes**

### Case Marking

Can be ergative.

### Adjectives

Usually **follow** the noun

- Strangely, there is also usually a small subset of adjectives that precede the noun

### Articles

Much more likely to have definite articles separate from demonstratives.

### Genitives

The genitive usually follows the noun

- ex: "The hat of John" rather than "John's hat"

### Wh-Movement

Usually to the front of the sentence.

## Verb-Medial Typology

Tend to be a mix of properties from verb-final and -initial languages.

### Universals for SVO

(Note that this does not include the other verb-medial category OVS)

1. **No ergative** case-marking
2. Clause-initial complementizers ("if", "that")
   1. In English you say "You can get coffee [IF you have $5]" where `[]` denotes the relative clause
      1. This is clause initial because "if" starts the relative clause
   2. Clause-final would be like "[you have $5 IF] you can get coffee"
3. No internally-headed relative clauses

## Nonconfigurational Languages

Quite a word!!! It just means languages that seem to have no fixed word order.

### Properties

1. Free word order
2. Null anaphora - The absence of nominal arguments (you can omit both the subject and the object)
3. Discontinuous constituents (wow this chapter loves big words) - Adjectives and other such modifiers do not immediately follow or precede the thing they modify

Very confusing! üôÉ And reserved for more advanced syntax classes
